- The navigation bar remains at the top of the page. It contains a logo to the left and the options to navigate to on the right.  
- The navigation bar remains consistent throughout all pages, except when in mobile display.

#### Navigation bar - Mobile (mockup)

- When the user is in mobile display, the navigation bar will collapse into a hamburger icon (created in css) to the left and only the page title will remain to the right. By doing this, the navigation bar will look less condensed and cluttered, thereby keeping a clean and minimal aesthetics when in mobile display mode, consequently improving user experience. 


#### Manu page - Mobile (mockup)

#### Home page - Tablet (mockup)

- Initially during the mockup stages of the design, the nagivation bar was meant to remain collapsed as a hamburger icon in tablet display as it does during mobile display. However, when implementing the design, the top of the page looked too empty, throwing off the visual balance of all the elements. So, the tablet display has the same navigation features as the desktop display.
